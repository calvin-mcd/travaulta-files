# travaulta files

This github folder contains the firmware file and source code for the travaulta, as well as the plate files for OEM, Niz and rgb housings. Niz and rgb plates have not yet been tested, keep that in mind.

Firmware for the topre vault35 pcb is largely based on Cipulot's [EC60](https://github.com/Cipulot/EC60). Big thanks to their open source topre work!!!
