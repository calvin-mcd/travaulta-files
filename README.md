# travaulta files

This github folder contains the firmware file and source code for the travaulta (go to the "firmware" folder!), as well as the plate files for OEM, Niz and rgb housings (see plate folder). Niz and rgb plates have not yet been tested, keep that in mind.

Firmware for the topre vault35 pcb is based on sp0rkus's (https://github.com/sporkus/) and Cipulot's (https://github.com/Cipulot) open source EC firmware. Huge thanks for both for their work & help!!!
